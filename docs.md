# Cyclic Blood Donation System - Comprehensive Documentation

## Project Overview

The Cyclic Blood Donation System is a comprehensive web application designed to manage the complete blood donation lifecycle in Egypt. It connects donors, hospitals, blood banks, and patients through an intelligent platform that optimizes blood collection, storage, and distribution based on location, priority, and medical requirements.

## Business Logic & Core Rules

### Critical Business Rules

1. **Blood Type Immutability**: Once a donor donates with a specific blood type, it cannot be changed for future donations
2. **90-Day Donation Interval**: Donors cannot donate again within 90 days of their last donation
3. **Blood Bank Selection**: Donors must select a blood bank when donating, which appears in their donation history
4. **Bank Employee Restrictions**: Bank employees can only manage donations for their assigned blood bank
5. **Location-Based Optimization**: System uses distance and priority algorithms for optimal blood request matching

### User Roles & Permissions

- **Donor**: Register, donate blood, view donation history
- **Hospital**: Register patients, create blood requests, manage patient records
- **Bank Employee**: Manage donations at their blood bank, accept/reject lab tests, monitor stock

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Framework**: Django 5.2 with Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive REST API with detailed endpoints

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with Create React App
- **UI Library**: Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with interceptors for token management
- **Notifications**: React Toastify for user feedback
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for navigation

### Key Features

#### 1. Intelligent Donation Management
```python
# 90-day interval enforcement
days_until_next = donor.days_until_next_donation
if days_until_next > 0:
    return Response({
        'error': f'You must wait {days_until_next} more days before your next donation.',
        'days_remaining': days_until_next
    })

# Blood type immutability
if donor.blood_type and donor.blood_type != blood_type:
    return Response({
        'error': f'Blood type cannot be changed. Your registered blood type is {donor.blood_type}'
    })
```

#### 2. Location-Based Optimization
```python
# Find nearby blood banks within 50km
nearby_banks = LocationService.find_nearby_blood_banks('Cairo', max_distance_km=50)

# Optimize blood request matching (70% priority, 30% distance)
optimized_matches = LocationService.optimize_blood_request_matching(
    blood_requests, priority_weight=0.7, distance_weight=0.3
)
```

#### 3. Bank Employee Workflow
- **Accept Donation**: Creates stock entry and notifies donor
- **Reject Donation**: Records reason and notifies donor
- **Bank-Specific Access**: Only see donations for their assigned blood bank

## System Lifecycle

### 1. Donor Journey
1. **Registration**: Create account with city and personal details
2. **First Donation**: Select blood type (permanently stored) and blood bank
3. **Lab Testing**: Bank employee accepts/rejects donation
4. **Notification**: Donor receives acceptance/rejection notification
5. **Future Donations**: Blood type locked, 90-day interval enforced

### 2. Hospital Journey
1. **Registration**: Create hospital account with location
2. **Patient Management**: Register patients with blood type and medical details
3. **Blood Requests**: Create requests with priority levels (immediate/urgent/normal)
4. **Matching**: System finds optimal blood banks based on distance and stock
5. **Fulfillment**: Receive blood allocation notifications

### 3. Blood Bank Journey
1. **Employee Registration**: Assign employees to specific blood banks
2. **Donation Processing**: Review incoming donations from donors
3. **Lab Testing**: Accept (create stock) or reject (with reason) donations
4. **Stock Management**: Monitor inventory, expiration dates, and alerts
5. **Request Fulfillment**: Process hospital blood requests

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Distance-Based Matching
- **Haversine Formula**: Accurate distance calculation between cities
- **Coverage Analysis**: Identifies cities without adequate blood bank coverage
- **Smart Routing**: Balances urgency with logistical efficiency

### 2. Priority Scoring System
```python
# Priority weights
priority_scores = {'high': 3, 'medium': 2, 'low': 1}

# Distance scoring (closer = higher score)
distance_score = max(0, (max_distance - actual_distance) / max_distance)

# Combined scoring
combined_score = (priority_score * 0.7) + (distance_score * 0.3)
```

### 3. Automated Notifications
- **Stock Expiry**: Alerts 7 days before expiration
- **Donation Status**: Immediate notifications on accept/reject
- **System Alerts**: Power outages, storage failures, equipment issues

## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
```
POST /api/register/          # User registration
POST /api/login/             # Authentication
GET  /api/profile/           # User profile

POST /api/donation/create/   # Create donation
GET  /api/donation/history/  # Donor history
GET  /api/donation/list/     # Bank employee list
POST /api/donation/accept/<id>/  # Accept donation
POST /api/donation/reject/<id>/  # Reject donation

GET  /api/bloodbanks/        # List blood banks
GET  /api/cities/            # List cities
POST /api/bloodrequests/     # Create blood request
```

## Database Schema

### Key Models
- **User**: Authentication and role management
- **Donor**: Blood type, donation history, 90-day tracking
- **Hospital**: Location, patient management
- **BloodBank**: Location, stock management
